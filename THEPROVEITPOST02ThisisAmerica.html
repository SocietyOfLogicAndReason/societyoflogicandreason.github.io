    <h3 style="font-size: 45px; margin: 0;">This is America!</h3>
    <p>By Ben Buck, post writer.</p>

    <p>People commonly call the United
States of America just “America”
but is just 1 of the 23 continental
American countries not including
the island countries. The name
"America" was first recorded on a
map made by the German
cartographer Martin Waldseemüller
in France in the year of our Lord
1,507 placed in south America. It
was the first map to show America
as a separate continent instead of
part of Asia. In a book that went
with the map apparently written by
Martin Waldseemüller's collaborator
Matthias Ringmann says "I do not
see what right any one would have
to object to calling this part [that is,
the South American mainland], after
Americus who discovered it and
who is a man of intelligence,
Amerigen, that is, the Land of
Americus, or America: since both
Europa and Asia got their names
from women" But its suspicious
because it was not the cartographer who named new lands but explorers or monarchs, and it was
tradition to only use first names of royal people and last names
of other people. His map did not reach Spain until after
Amerigo Vespucci's death. So the name may have came from
the Amerrisque Mountains in Nicaragua where Christopher
Columbus landed on his 4th voyage. Amerrisque means
“country of the Wind” so it may have changed to America and
then spread by spoken language throughout Europe relatively
quickly even reaching Martin Waldseemüller. Either way America became the name of the new double continent. Later
the British colonized part of America and call it British
America because it was the part of America the British owned.
Part of British America became the 13 colonies and became a
independent country and called themselves the United States of
America because it was colonies that where now states that
where united in America. But United States of America is so
much work to say that people are lazy and just call it “United
states” or “America” but United states could be confused with
the United States of Colombia (Year of our Lord 1,863-1,886)
or the United Mexican States witch conveniently is in a
different order. But you can just call those “Colombia” and
“Mexico” without confusion (except for maybe all of America
should be called Colombia after Christopher Columbus who
usually gets the credit for discovering it) So if you are to lazy
to say United States of America its better to say United States
because the United States of Colombia don't exist anymore and
Mexico is in a different order, but if you call it America then it
can be confused with the double continent of America witch in
some countries is considered 1 continent called America. Or
you could call it the USA witch if they know what it stands for
they wont be confused. As for what you call someone from the
United States of America, most people call them Americans
but this is confused with Americans. Some people call them
“United-Statesian” which is better but a Mexican could just as
easily call as a United-Statesian. So you can call the USAmericans but this is lazy so they should be called “United
States of Americans” calling the United States of America
“America” is like calling France “Eurasia” and so you compare
America and Canada you could compare Eurasia and Spain.
That makes no sense! And calling united states of Americans
“Americans” would be like calling people from Central
African Republic “Africans”. So the United States of America
in in America and people from the are United States of
Americans! The problem is the United States of America does
not have a name, just a title of what it is.</p>
