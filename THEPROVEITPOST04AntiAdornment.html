    <h3 style="font-size: 45px; margin: 0;">Girls shouldn't adorn themselves
in vain jewelry and make up!!!!
</h3>
    <p>By Ben Buck, post writer.</p>

    <p>Stop wearing jewelry: earrings, finger rings, necklaces, bracelets, and the
like!!! Stop wearing makeup on your eyelids and face, and lipstick on
your lips and painting your nails!!! Stop styling your hair!!! Do you wish
to please the world or follow the scriptures? But what do the scriptures
say? It is written: “Likewise also women should adorn themselves in
respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair
or gold or pearls or costly clothing, but with good works, as is proper for
women who profess godliness.” 1 Timothy 2:9-11
It is also written: “Do not let your adorning be outward - braiding of hair
and putting around of gold, or putting on of garments, but the hidden man
of the heart, in the imperishable of the gentle and quiet spirit, which is of
great worth before God.” 1 Peter 3:3-4</p>
<h3>What should you NOT do?</h3>
<p>“Not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing”
“Do not let your adorning be outward - braiding of hair and putting
around of gold, or putting on of garments”
That is 3 forbidden things:
<br>1 braided hair
<br>2 gold and pearls
<br>3 costly clothing
Gold, pearls and costly clothing are expensive. Do not waste your money
on vain adornment when you could be giving the money to feed someone
who is dying of starvation. However its not just about money, its about
not decorating your outward appearance to draw attention. So you should
not wear jewelry even if you get it for free, like earrings, noes rings,
finger rings, necklaces, bracelets, anklelets or fake gold, fake pearls and
gems. Don't wear cheap fashion clothing either for Peter just says
“putting on of garments” referring to adorning yourself in garments,
instead of them being just to clothe yourself. Braided hair is not
expensive. So modifying outward appearance to draw attention in any
way like wearing makeup on your eyelids and face, and lipstick on your
lips and painting your fingernails nails and toenails, styling your hair
straightening curly hair, curling straightening hair, dying your hair, and
other such vanities are not to be done! Are you not content with the way
God made your hair? by changing your hair and your face you are
rejecting the beauty God gave you and are exchanging it for the beauty of
the gentiles. Or wearing high heels, they are not practical and just to
make you look taller, why do you want to look taller anyway? For it is
written: “...the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the
outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.” 1 Samuel 16:7
It is also written: “Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.” Proverbs 31:30
Engagement rings and marriage rings could be argued as not vain because
of there symbolism, however why do they need to be gold and/or have a
diamond or gem on them? Just symbolism? Or a excuse for vain
adornment. Not to mention the money people spend on them.
So the ring itself may not be vain, but the diamond is.</p>
<h3>What should you do?</h3>
<p>“Likewise also women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel,
with modesty and self-control,.......with good works, as is proper for
women who profess godliness. Let a woman learn in quietness, in all
submissiveness. But I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to use
authority over a man, but to to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first,
then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been
deceived, has come into transgression. But she will be saved through
childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with selfcontrol. ” 1 Timothy 2:9,11-15
“Likewise wives, be subject to the own husbands so that, even if any are
disobedient to the word, they will be won over without word by the
conduct of the wives, having witnessed your respectful, pure conduct, Do
not let your adorning be outward …. but the hidden man of the heart, in
the imperishable of the gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth
before God. For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who
trusted in God also adorned themselves, being subject to the own
husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, of whom you have
become children, doing good and not fearing any consternation” 1 Peter
3:1-2,4-6
So wear modest, respectable apparel. Not vain or immodest clothing, or
ornaments on you body, But “let your adorning be of the heart” question
what you put on. Is it decorating your outward appearance to draw
attention?
</p>
<h3>Objection</h3>
<p>Someone will say: “I can do both, as long as I am adorning
my hart I can also have external adornments as long as there not
important to me” NO! It is written: “Do not let your adorning be
outward .” “..women <span style="font-size:28px; font-style:italic;font-weight:600;">should</span> adorn themselves in respectable
apparel,... <span style="font-size:28px; font-style:italic;font-weight:600;">Not</span> with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing...”
If God does not care for your outward adornments, than who do you
adorn yourself for? Yourself? No you can't see your your own head. For
others? Who do you want to be attractive to? The Gentiles? Any Godly
man would see your outward adornment as ugly! It is written: “Charm is
deceitful and beauty is vain, But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall
be praised.” Proverbs 31:30 If your adornments are not important to you
then why not take them off? If you will not take them off then they must
be important to you.</p>
<p>But why is this addressed to woman. What about men? Well think about
it who is adorning themselves outwardly? Woman. Yes some times guys
do some of these things like tattoos, stylish hair cuts, vain
expensive cowboy boots and vain watches, or body building just for
looks. Anything that is outward used to gain attention. And guys are
certainly not exempt, but to them they write: “I desire therefore that themen pray
everywhere, lifting up holy hands,
without wrath and doubting”
“Husbands, likewise, dwell with
them with understanding, giving
honor to the wife, as to the weaker
vessel, and as being heirs together of
the grace of life, that your prayers
may not be hindered.”
<br>(1 Timothy 2:.8, 1 Peter 3:7)
